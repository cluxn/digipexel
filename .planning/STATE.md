## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Static export Next.js — all dynamic content must be fetched client-side via API calls (no SSR at runtime)
- [Init]: PHP REST API with no framework — follow existing action-based POST routing pattern
- [Init]: Exit-intent only for nudges — B2B buyers close timed popups immediately
- [Init]: No About Us page, no Waitlist, no Pricing page, no FAQ — user decisions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- init_db.php must remain accessible (server migration still in progress) — do not block it
- No staging environment — all deploys go direct to production via GitHub Actions SFTP
